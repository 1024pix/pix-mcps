# Session Progress: MCP Prompts Implementation
**Date:** 2025-01-07
**Topic:** Implementing analyze-ticket MCP prompt

## Session Goals
1. ✅ Understand MCP prompts primitive
2. ✅ Implement analyze-ticket prompt for JIRA
3. ✅ Create comprehensive beginner documentation
4. ✅ Follow TDD practices with full test coverage
5. ✅ Apply clean code principles (self-documenting, no unnecessary comments)

## What Was Built

### Core Features

#### 1. analyze-ticket Prompt (`servers/pix-jira/src/prompts/analyze-ticket.ts`)
- Fetches JIRA ticket data using the existing JIRA client
- Formats ticket information for analysis (key, type, status, description, etc.)
- Constructs structured prompt with analysis framework for Claude:
  - Complexity assessment (Low/Medium/High)
  - Potential technical risks
  - Dependencies and integration points
  - Recommended development approach
- Handles errors gracefully (API failures, missing tickets)
- Returns structured content for Claude to analyze

**Key design decisions:**
- Separated prompt logic from tool interface for testability
- Used descriptive function names instead of inline comments
- Created small, focused functions (addBasicInformationSection, addLabelsSection, etc.)
- Extracted constants (ISSUE_FIELDS_TO_FETCH) for maintainability

#### 2. Tool Wrapper (`servers/pix-jira/src/tools/analyze-ticket.ts`)
- Wraps the prompt execution with MCP tool interface
- Validates input with Zod schema (issue key must match PROJ-1234 format)
- Returns standardized MCP responses (success or error)
- Integrates seamlessly with existing tool infrastructure

#### 3. Tests (`servers/pix-jira/src/prompts/analyze-ticket.test.ts`)
- 9 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Complete ticket data analysis
  - Issue key normalization (lowercase → uppercase)
  - Labels, parent issues, related issues inclusion
  - Custom fields extraction
  - JiraApiException handling
  - Generic error handling
  - Unknown error scenarios
- All tests passing ✅
- Uses Vitest with mocked JIRA client

### Documentation

#### 1. Prompts Guide for Beginners (`servers/pix-jira/docs/prompts-guide.md`)
A comprehensive guide covering:
- What MCP prompts are and the three MCP primitives (Tools, Resources, Prompts)
- Why use prompts vs tools
- How prompts work in this project (architecture diagram)
- Step-by-step guide to building your own prompt
- Key concepts (separation of concerns, testability, reusability)
- Real example walkthrough (analyze-ticket)
- Testing best practices
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Future SDK enhancements

**Target audience:** Developers new to MCP or building their first prompt

#### 2. Prompts vs Tools Guide (`servers/pix-jira/docs/prompts-vs-tools.md`)
A decision framework document covering:
- Quick answer comparison
- When to use tools (actions, data retrieval, simple operations)
- When to use prompts (analysis, synthesis, domain expertise)
- Side-by-side comparison table
- Decision framework with 4 key questions
- Common patterns (tool + prompt combination, tool wraps prompt)
- Real-world examples (code review, database queries, data visualization)
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Rule of thumb: "If you can automate without AI → tool, if you need reasoning → prompt"

**Target audience:** Anyone deciding whether to implement a feature as a tool or prompt

#### 3. Updated README (`servers/pix-jira/README.md`)
- Added `analyze_ticket` tool to Available Tools section
- Included parameters, usage examples, and what it provides
- Added Prompts section with links to guides
- Updated Future Enhancements to include more prompts

#### 4. Developer Learnings (`docs/developer-learnings.md`)
Added section on MCP Prompts Implementation covering:
- Pattern for implementing prompts as tools (current SDK limitation)
- Separation of concerns (prompt logic vs tool wrapper)
- Decision framework (prompts vs tools)
- Prompt message structure best practices
- Function extraction pattern for clean code
- Testing approaches for prompts
- Future SDK support expectations

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Prompts as Tools Pattern
**Decision:** Implement prompts as tools that return structured analysis frameworks

**Rationale:**
- Anthropic SDK doesn't yet have native prompt support in `createSdkMcpServer()`
- This pattern keeps prompt logic testable and reusable
- Easy to migrate to native prompts when SDK supports it

**Implementation:**
```
src/prompts/     ← Pure business logic, no MCP coupling
src/tools/       ← MCP interface wrapper
```

### 2. Function Extraction Over Comments
**Decision:** Use descriptive function names instead of inline comments

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before: const sections = []; // Add basic info
// After: addBasicInformationSection(sections, issue.key, fields);
```

**Rationale:**
- Pix coding standard preference
- Comments can become outdated; function names are always in sync
- Small functions are easier to test and understand
- Reduces visual noise

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
**Decision:** Create two separate guides (beginners guide + decision framework)

**Rationale:**
- Different audiences have different needs
- Beginners need step-by-step instructions
- Experienced developers need quick decision criteria
- Avoids mixing teaching with reference material

### 4. Test-Driven Development
**Decision:** Write tests before finalizing implementation

**Results:**
- 9 tests, all passing
- Caught formatting issues early
- Improved code design through testability pressure
- Provides regression protection for future changes

## Code Quality Metrics

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ All tests passing: 13/13 (including 9 new prompt tests)
- ✅ Build successful: Clean production build
- ✅ No inline comments: Self-documenting code
- ✅ Function size: Small, focused functions (5-20 lines each)
- ✅ Test coverage: All execution paths tested

## Usage Example

```typescript
// User in Claude Code
"Analyze ticket PROJ-1234"

// What happens:
// 1. analyze_ticket tool is invoked
// 2. Fetches PROJ-1234 data from JIRA
// 3. Formats into structured prompt
// 4. Returns analysis framework to Claude
// 5. Claude analyzes and responds with:
//    - Complexity: Medium-High
//    - Risks: [OAuth2 security, breaking changes]
//    - Dependencies: [Identity providers, token management]
//    - Approach: [Implementation strategy with subtasks]
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. MCP Prompts Architecture
- Prompts guide Claude's reasoning with structured frameworks
- Different from tools which perform actions or fetch data
- Current SDK requires implementing prompts as tools
- Future SDK will support native prompt registration

### 2. When to Use Prompts vs Tools
**Tools**: "Get me X" (data retrieval, actions)
**Prompts**: "Help me understand Y" (analysis, synthesis)

Decision rule: **If you need AI reasoning, it's a prompt. If you can automate without AI, it's a tool.**

### 3. Clean Code Practices
- Function names should tell the story
- Extract functions instead of writing comments
- Each function should have one clear responsibility
- Variables and constants should have descriptive names

### 4. Testing Prompts
- Mock external dependencies (JIRA client)
- Test content structure, not exact wording
- Cover error scenarios thoroughly
- Test data transformations (normalization, formatting)

### 5. Documentation for Different Audiences
- Beginners need tutorials and examples
- Experienced developers need decision frameworks
- Both need clear, concise explanations
- Link documents together for navigation

## Future Enhancements

### Near-term
- [ ] Add more analysis prompts (sprint retrospective, code review, security assessment)
- [ ] Implement resources primitive (expose JIRA queries as resources)
- [ ] Create prompt for generating PR descriptions from tickets

### Long-term
- [ ] Migrate to native prompt support when SDK releases it
- [ ] Build prompt composition (one prompt calling another)
- [ ] Add prompt arguments for customizing analysis depth/focus
- [ ] Create prompt library for common JIRA workflows
